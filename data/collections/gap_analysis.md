**SERP Themes:**

*   **Established Local Provider:** Applied Arts Ltd. is presented as a long-standing (since 1994) provider of web design, FileMaker Pro development, and website management in Lexington, KY.
*   **Local Business Support Ecosystem:** The presence of initiatives like "Awesome Inc," Commerce Lexington Inc. (including the Bluegrass Business Development Partnership), and the Kentucky Small Business Development Center (KSBDC) indicates a supportive environment for businesses seeking digital services.
*   **Government & Technology Services:** The mention of Lextran contracting with Zed Digital and TCG America offering technology solutions suggests that government entities and larger tech firms are also active in the Lexington market for web-related services.

**Identified Gaps:**

*   **Specific Service Details for Applied Arts Ltd.:** While Applied Arts Ltd. is mentioned, there's a lack of detail regarding their specific web design methodologies, portfolio, client testimonials, or the breadth of their web design services beyond FileMaker Pro specialization.
*   **Competitive Landscape Analysis:** Beyond Applied Arts Ltd., Zed Digital, and TCG America, the competitive landscape of website design agencies in Lexington is not fully mapped out. Information on other direct competitors, their specializations, and market share is missing.
*   **Buyer Journey Stage Coverage:** The provided snippets focus on the existence of services and support resources rather than guiding potential clients through the decision-making process (e.g., "how to choose a web designer," "what to expect during the design process").
*   **FileMaker Pro vs. General Web Design:** The emphasis on FileMaker Pro for Applied Arts Ltd. might overshadow their general web design capabilities, leaving a gap in understanding their broader web design offerings for clients who may not require FileMaker expertise.

**Opportunities:**

*   **Expand on Applied Arts Ltd.'s Web Design Services:** Detail their general web design capabilities, showcase a portfolio of non-FileMaker Pro projects, and highlight their experience with different types of businesses in Lexington.
*   **Profile Other Lexington Web Design Agencies:** Identify and detail other local web design firms, their unique selling propositions, target markets, and services. This would provide a more complete competitive overview.
*   **Develop Content Addressing Buyer Needs:** Create resources that guide potential clients through the website design process, such as checklists for choosing an agency, understanding project timelines, and defining project scope.
*   **Clarify Web Design vs. FileMaker Pro Specialization:** Create content that clearly distinguishes between Applied Arts Ltd.'s general web design services and their specialized FileMaker Pro offerings, allowing potential clients to better understand if they are the right fit for their needs.
