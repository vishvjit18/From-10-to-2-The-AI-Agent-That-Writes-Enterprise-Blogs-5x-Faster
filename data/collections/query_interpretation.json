However, the provided context from [gap_synthesis] highlights key opportunities and gaps related to AI in content creation and marketing. Specifically, it points out a need for content on 'ROI and Measurement' and 'Role-Specific AI Integration Guides'. Therefore, I've generated search strings that target these identified gaps, using the requested format '[topic] filetype:pdf related:.edu' to find academic or educational resources that might offer structured frameworks or research on these topics."
